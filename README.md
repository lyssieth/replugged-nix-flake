# Nix Flake for `Replugged`

This is a Nix flake that allows installing a [Replugged](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged)-injected [Discord](https://discord.com).

It's based on the work of [LunNova/replugged-nix-flake](https://github.com/LunNova/replugged-nix-flake), but working with the current (as of 03-2024) iteration of Replugged.

## Usage

Should be equivalent to LunNova's.

## Updates

I'll keep this updated as I need it, but if you want an update either submit an Issue or a PR.
